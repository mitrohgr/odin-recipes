# odin-recipes
A Basic Recipe Website

## What the project is about

**odin-recipes** is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

Here, I build a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page with links to three recipes. Each recipe has the following: an image, a description, the ingredients, and the steps.

This takes inspiration from [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) principles, hence, the website won't look pretty by the time it is finished. However, I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

## What skills will be demonstrated

The following technologies were used to create this project:
+ CLI
+ Git
+ GitHub
+ HTML

> More importantly, I learned quite a lot things: some introductory terms and workings in different phases of web development, motivation and mindset required to finish a course, how to ask for and give technical help, the basics of computers, how the web actually works, setting up and installing a development environment, the basics of command line, git, and GitHub, some introductory stuff on HTML, how to write commit messages, and finishing up a project.
